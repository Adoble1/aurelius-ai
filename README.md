# aurelius-ai
An interactive AI allowing you to converse with the mind of Marcus Aurelius, grounded in his Meditations. A demo for InnerMonologue AI
Aurelius AI: Access the operating system of a Roman Emperor.This project is a demonstration of a new class of AI that models a specific mind, not the whole internet. It allows you to have an interactive conversation with the philosophy and wisdom of Marcus Aurelius, with responses grounded in his actual writings from Meditations.➡️ LIVE DEMO ⬅️
The Core Idea: Standard AI models (like ChatGPT) are designed to know a little about everything. They are generalists.This project explores a different path: creating a "legacy model" that embodies the specific knowledge, reasoning, and style of a single individual. The result is not an impersonation, but an interactive model of a mind that you can learn from and reason with.
This demo is the first step towards InnerMonologue AI, a platform designed to allow individuals to create their own interactive digital legacy.
Technology: This demonstration is built with a simple but powerful stack:HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: The entire experience is a self-contained web application.Tailwind CSS: For clean, modern styling.
Gemini API: The AI's conversational ability is powered by Google's Gemini model.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): The AI's responses are grounded by retrieving relevant passages from a corpus of Marcus Aurelius's writings before generating an answer. This ensures philosophical authenticity.
